As part of my volunteer work at International Justice Mission (IJM), Ghana, I built a simple form to help automate the registration process for people who wanted to become volunteers. I took time to plan out the tools I would use before starting, so I was completed the project in about 5 days. I was the sole developer, and was able to sign up about 20 people using the form. The site was hosted on Google Cloud at https://arise-conference-2021.nw.r.appspot.com/. It was a temporary solution for an event that was held then (2021 Arise Conference), and may have been shut down after that.
